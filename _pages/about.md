<br/><br/>

Hi, I'm **C M**, *Abdullah* **Khan**.<br>
I'm currently working as a Software Engineer at **[IdeaScale]** (Oct 2023 - Present), where I contribute to building
innovative platforms that help organizations harness the power of collective intelligence and drive meaningful innovation.<br>

Previously, I spent 4 years at **Bangladesh Japan Information Technology (BJIT)** (Oct 2019 - Oct 2023),
where I developed enterprise-scale microservices for international clients including the largest Japanese E-Commerce client,
handling billions of daily requests with significant performance improvements through asynchronous development.<br>

Working through difficult issues in Computer Science and Engineering excites me, and I'm passionate about creating
scalable solutions that make a real impact.<br>

## What I Do

As a Software Engineer, I focus on developing robust, user-centric applications and solving complex technical challenges.
I enjoy the entire software development lifecycle - from architecting solutions to implementing features that enhance user experience.

## Technical Expertise

**Core Technologies**: Spring Boot, Java (8-21), Kotlin, Reactive Spring, Microservices Architecture
**Databases**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, DynamoDB, Redis, ElasticSearch
**Cloud & DevOps**: AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda, SNS), Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, ArgoCD
**Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, Kibana, Sleuth, Zipkin
**Specializations**:
- High-performance backend systems capable of handling billions of requests
- Microservices migration from monolithic architectures
- GraphQL-like API frameworks for optimized data exchange
- Geospatial applications with advanced routing algorithms

## Education & Community

**Education**: Bachelor of Computer Science and Engineering from International University of Business Agriculture and Technology (IUBAT), graduating with a CGPA of 3.43/4.0.

**Open Source Contributions**: Active contributor with merged pull requests in Spring Boot and Micronaut-Kafka repositories.

**Speaking & Mentoring**: Conference speaker on Java, Spring Boot, and backend development best practices. Passionate about mentoring and inspiring the next generation of engineers.

**Technical Writing**: Reviewed Java programming books including bestsellers in Bangladesh, contributing to the developer community's knowledge base.

## Notable Projects

**Japanese E-commerce Application**: Enhanced REST APIs with GraphQL-like features for mission-critical microservices serving over a billion daily requests.

**Japanese Theme Park Application**: Developed geospatial systems with K-Shortest Path algorithms using PostGIS for optimized routing.

**WhiteBoard Application**: Currently developing collaborative whiteboard with Docker/Kubernetes deployment pipelines.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, and sharing knowledge through conferences and this blog.

## Let's Connect

I'm always interested in connecting with fellow developers, discussing new ideas, and exploring collaboration opportunities. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat about technology, share insights, or discuss potential projects.
